I walked my dog Logan

I went to school
period 1
I have Driver's Ed first period.
It is boring when we are in the classroom, but the simulators and range are fun.
The simulators are not very realistic because you can pull off moves that you definitely can't in real life, but they are still good for practice.
Range is good for learning how to turn, park, and the other little techniques of driving. 
Even though you don't go faster than 5 miles per hour in range, it is still fun.
